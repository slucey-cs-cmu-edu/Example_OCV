# Example_OCV

Simple example for Lecture 1 of 16423. Simply showing how to build an
executable on the command line for OpenCV. Demonstrates how numbers in
the Mat Class are row ordered. Assuming everyone is using a MAC here. 

To build, simply ensure the OpenCV path in Make_Darwin is set
correctly.
